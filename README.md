## Usage
### Navigation
Executing the tool, it shows an empty window with a chunk and a region grid. To actually show a world, open a folder containing Minecraft Anvil (\*.mca) files. The tool will then render a top-down view of this world that you can zoom into and zoom out of by scrolling up and down and that you can move around using the middle mouse button (`Cmd+LMB` on Mac OS) or using `WASD`.

![alt text](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/302f2ec9ea76913c1fdd217415d623bb776e4e77/mca_selector_default.png "MCA Selector window showing chunk and region grid")

Zooming out far enough disables the selection of single chunks but lets you select entire regions.

### Selections
Upon finishing selecting chunks and regions, they can be deleted or exported using the `Selection`-menu. Exported chunks and regions are not deleted from the original world.

![alt text](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/d708eafb98e62a99e26735c166dc8fdcecf17185/mca_selector_selections.png "MCA Selector window showing chunk and region selection export")

A selection (not the chunks and regions themselves) can also be exported or imported and even be applied to different worlds.

### Chunk filter
The MCA Selector also contains a powerful tool to delete or export chunks and regions by conditions like the data version, the time it was last updated, how much time players have spent in this chunk and some more. Multiple of these conditions can be used to create a very specific query describing what chunks and regions should be deleted or exported.

![alt text](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/a977a7b2b4844123262003268992dcf0b80c337c/mca_selector_filter_chunks.png "MCA Selector window showing the chunk filter")

Because the conditions use internal values used by Minecraft, the following table gives a brief explanation on what they do:

| Condition | Type | Description |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Group | - | Groups multiple conditions. |
| DataVersion | int | The DataVersion tag of the chunk. 100-1343 for 1.12.2 and below, 1444 for 1.13 snapshots and above. |
| InhabitedTime | long | The total amount of time in game-ticks players have spent in that chunk. 1 second ~20 ticks. Also accepts a duration string such as `1 year 2 months 3 days 4 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds`. |
| LastUpdate | int | The time a chunk was last updated in seconds since 1970-01-01. Also accepts a timestamp in the `yyyy-MM-dd HH-mm-ss`-format such as `2018-01-02 15:03:04`. If the time is omitted, it will default to `00:00:00`. |
| xPos | int | The location of the chunk on the x-axis in chunk coordinates. |
| zPos | int | The location of the chunk on the z-axis in chunk coordinates. |
| Palette | String | A list of comma (,) separated 1.13 block names. The block names will be converted to block ids for chunks with DataVersion 1343 or below. The validation of block names can be skipped by writing them in single quotes ('). Example: `sand,'new_block',gravel`.|
| Status | String | The status of the chunk generation. Only recognized by Minecraft 1.13+ (DataVersion 1444+) |
| LightPopulated | byte | Whether the light levels for the chunk have been calculated. If this is set to 0, converting a world from 1.12.x to 1.13 will omit that chunk. Allowed values are `0` and `1`. |
| Biome | String | One or multiple biome names, separated by comma (,). For a reference of biome names, have a look at the [Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_data_values#Biomes). |
| Entities | String | One or multiple entity names, separated by comma (,). For a reference of entity names, have a look at the [Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_data_values#Entities). |
| #Entities | int | The total amount of entities in that chunk. |
| #TileEntities | int | The total amount of tile entities in that chunk. |

Fields that allow multiple comma separated values act the same as multiple consecutive filters of the same type with single values connected with the `AND` operator.

**Notice**
Running the query will check the `.mca`-file's name first if the query would even apply to any chunk in this file using the xPos and zPos conditions, as long as the query is built in a way that allows doing this.

### NBT Changer
The NBT Changer modifies the world files directly by changing specific values.

![alt text](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/a977a7b2b4844123262003268992dcf0b80c337c/mca_selector_change_nbt.png "MCA Selector window showing the nbt changer")

You can change the following values:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| LightPopulated | byte | Whether the light levels for the chunk have been calculated. If this is set to `0`, converting a world from 1.12.x to 1.13 will omit that chunk. Allowed values are `0` and `1` |
| DataVersion | int | Allows to change the DataVersion of the chunks. Should be used with extreme care. |
| InhabitedTime | long | This field stores the amount of game-ticks players have spent in a chunk. Impacts the local difficulty. |
| LastUpdate | long | Stores a timestamp when this chunk was last updated in Milliseconds. |
| Status | String | The status of the chunk generation. Only recognized by Minecraft 1.13+ (DataVersion 1444+) |
| Biome | String | A biome name. This sets all biomes of this chunk to a single biome. For a reference of biome names, have a look at the [Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_data_values#Biomes). |
| DeleteEntities | boolean | If set to `1` or `true`, all entities in that chunk will be deleted. |

Once the field is highlighted in green, the value is considered valid and will be changed. A gray field, no matter its content, will be ignored.

For more information about the fields have a look at the chunk format description on [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk_format)

### Chunk Editor
When selecting a single chunk, the menu "Edit chunks" becomes available. It allows precise editing of the entire NBT structure of that chunk. Names and values can be changed, added, deleted or moved (drag & drop).

![alt text](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/a977a7b2b4844123262003268992dcf0b80c337c/mca_selector_edit_chunk.png "MCA Selector window showing the NBT editor")

**Notice** When the NBT editor does not show any data, the cached top-down view might be outdated and the chunk might not exist anymore in the mca files. In that case, clearing the cache will rerender the regions from scratch and show the up-to-date top-down view.

### Chunk import
Importing chunks can be easily done by opening the target world first using `File --> Open` and then merging the chunks of a second world using `Tools --> Import chunks`. After selecting a folder containing region files, it is possible to import the chunks with a specific offset. Doing so automatically adjusts relevant values to the new location of the chunk.

![alt text](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/a977a7b2b4844123262003268992dcf0b80c337c/mca_selector_import_chunks.png "MCA Selector window showing the chunk import")

**Notice**
Commands inside of command blocks will not be changed.
Maps will not be updated, because their data is not stored inside region files.

### Caching
The tool creates an image for each region from the provided mca-files. These images are saved separately inside a `cache`-folder in the working directory of the program for future usage. Experience showed that a Minecraft world with a size of 10GB resulted in cached image files with a total size of 80-100MB. Caching as many regions as possible significantly improves loading times though.

### Debugging
If something is not working properly or if you want to see the exact query that is run using the chunk filter, debugging can be enabled in the settings. It will print useful information about what the program is currently doing to the console.

### Filter query

A filter query is a text representation of the chunk filter that can be created in the UI of the program. When the debug mode is enabled, it will be printed into the console.
Example:
```
--query "xPos >= 10 AND xPos <= 20 AND Palette contains \"sand,water\""
```
This will select all chunks that contain sand and water blocks and their x-position ranges from 10 to 20.
As shown, double quotes (") must be escaped with a backslash.

### Change values

The query for changing NBT values in chunks looks slightly different to the filter query. It is a comma (,) separated list of assignments.
Example:
```
--query "LightPopulated = 1, Status = empty"
```
This will set the field "LightPopulated" to "1" and "Status" to "empty". Just like the filter query, the query to change values is printed to the console when using the UI in debug mode.

## Download and installation

[**Download Version 1.9.3**](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector/releases/download/1.9.3/mcaselector-1.9.3.jar)

"Requirements":
* Either:
  * JRE 8+, you can get it from [HERE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
  * A Minecraft Java Edition installation
* A computer
* A brain

#### If you have Java from Oracle installed on your system

Most likely, `.jar` files are associated with java on your computer, it should therefore launch by simply double clicking the file (or however your OS is configured to open files using your mouse or keyboard). If not, you can try `java -jar mcaselector-1.9.3.jar` from your console. If this doesn't work, you might want to look into how to modify the `PATH` variable on your system to tell your system that java is an executable program.

#### If you have Minecraft Java Edition installed on your system

Minecraft Java Edition comes with a JRE that you can use to start the MCA Selector, so there is no need to install another version of java on your system. On Windows, that java version is usually located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Minecraft\runtime\jre-x64\bin\` and once inside this folder you can simply run `java.exe -jar <path-to-mcaselector-1.9.3.jar>`. On Mac OS you should find it in `Applications/Minecraft.app/Contents/runtime/jre-x64/1.8.0_74/bin` where you can execute `./java -jar <path-to-mcaselector-1.9.3.jar>`.

#### If you are using OpenJDK

If you are using a distribution of OpenJDK, you have to make sure that it comes with JavaFX, as it is needed to run the MCA Selector. Some distributions like AdoptOpenJDK (shipped with most Linux distributions) do not ship with JavaFX by default. On Debian distributions, an open version of JavaFX is contained in the `openjfx` package. This or some other installation of JavaFX is required to run the `.jar`.
##
If none of these instructions work, apply "A brain" that you providently held ready after having read the "Requirements" section carefully.
